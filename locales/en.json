  "explanation": {
    "title": "How It Works",
    "section-1": "The DVoice remuneration and utilization framework operates under a dual-instrument economic structure predicated on the interplay between two fungible units of account: the digital internal computation token known as <strong>Dcoin (DC)</strong> and the national fiat standard denominated in Uzbek so‘m (<strong>UZS</strong>). The architecture is designed to abstract resource consumption from real-world currency by way of intermediary digital credits, which serve as the primary vehicle for quantifying linguistic payload throughput.",
    "section-2": "Upon successful account registration, users are provisioned with a base-level plan — denominated as the \"Start Tariff\" — which is characterized by a non-monetized access layer (0 UZS per billing cycle), a zero allocation of Dcoin balance, and no dynamic discount coefficients. Subsequent character-based interactions with the TTS (Text-to-Speech) or TTS-Stream (Streaming TTS) services initiate deduction events calibrated on a per-character basis, contingent on the designated synthesis model. For example, under the Iroda model configuration, the synchronous TTS service executes a deduction of <strong>0.17 DC per character</strong>, whereas its streaming analog (TTS-Stream) exacts a marginally elevated toll of <strong>0.19 DC per character</strong>, reflecting its continuous audio provisioning behavior.",
    "section-3": "Should a user's Dcoin balance reach a null state, the system automatically transitions into a contingency mode in which subsequent character costs are extracted directly from the UZS balance at a strict 1:1 conversion ratio (1 DC ≡ 1 UZS). This transition occurs transparently, without user confirmation, to maintain uninterrupted synthesis operations. Notably, if a user is subscribed to an elevated tariff tier that includes a discount policy (e.g., 5% reduction post-depletion), the adjusted per-character cost will reflect this coefficient, resulting in marginally optimized consumption rates.",
    "section-4": "Premium tariff plans offer access to bulk-acquisition protocols via fixed-rate monthly contracts — such as 150,000 DC for 129,000 UZS — yielding both a net per-character cost advantage and preferential post-threshold pricing behavior. These plans are structured to incentivize predictive usage modeling, enabling users to pre-purchase voice generation capacity at favorable conversion ratios. The system's internal accounting mechanism allocates Dcoin reserves prior to initiating any fiat deduction, and only after full depletion is fallback extraction from the monetary account initiated, unless otherwise specified via administrative override or backend override logic.",
    "section-5": "The transactional engine behind this billing logic is governed by a smart prioritization queue that evaluates balance sources in order of abstraction efficiency, applying tariff-based rulesets in conjunction with model-specific pricing logic and API access context (synchronous vs. streaming). This ensures that users experience a seamless character-to-speech transformation flow while maintaining optimal cost-routing logic underneath.",
    "section-6": "It is important to note that this system, while highly scalable and modular, presupposes a baseline familiarity with tokenized billing logic and usage-based microtransaction modeling. Users are advised to monitor their Dcoin balance and tariff status periodically through the provided dashboard interface to ensure continuous and cost-efficient operation of the speech synthesis pipeline.",
